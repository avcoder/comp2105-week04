# todo

- Last week I said to use: transition: 2s; which means transition: all 2s ease
- This week we'll go into transition more in depth and see more properties
- So transition: all 2s ease really means transition-property: all; transition-duration: 2s; transition-timing-function: ease
- transforms (pose to pose) go with transitions (straight ahead)
- long hand vs short hand

# CSS Transitions

- read it

# (When to move)

- this is my way of thinking of it
- in order for an animation to do something, you have to define when to move it (if button is being hovered upon)
- what to change = transform
- how to move = transition

# same black slide

- so you need a trigger
- some kind of animatable property to change something
- some kind of transition to define how you're going to move it, without it, it'll be a jump-cut

# All equivalent

- So last week I immediately showed you the short-hand notation
- This week I'll show you the long-hand notation.
- just like other CSS props that have long hand vs short hand, transition is like that
- when you use transition, you have a choice between 5 to 6 different props
- only 1 of them is required, the rest are optional

# transition-property
